# How To Write Markdown: Notes

## Headings:
* \# = first-level-heading
* \## = second-level heading
* \### = third-level heading
## Styling
* ** or __ __ = bold
* \* \* or _ _= italic
* ~~ ~~ = strikethrough
* ** ** and _ _ = bold and nested italic
* *** *** = all bold and italic
* \<sup> and \</sup> - superscript
## Quoting text:
* Use > to begin text that is a quote
* Use ``(backticks) to call out code within a sentence. This will not be formatted. 
* Use triple backticks to format code or text into it's own distinct block. 
* Backticks can be used before hexadecimal colors to indicate the color. 
## Links:
* Create inline link by wrapping link text in brackets and wrapping the URL in parentheses. Or just use command k
* This site was built using \[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
Images: 
* ! denotes that you are displaying an image, then wrap alt text in [] and link in ()
## Nested lists:
* Have first line item, then put either \- or \* to begin the nested list on the next line, directly below the first letter on the top line 
* To create a task list, preface list items with a hyphen and space followed by \[ ]
To mark a task as complete, use \[x]

Add footnotes to text using bracket syntax:
* Here is a simple footnote\[^1].
\[^1]: My reference. 
* To add line breaks within a footnote, prefix new lines with two spaces. 
* Hide comments with HTML comments: \<!--     \-->
Escape markdown formatting using \\


# Lecture 1/17/24: History

* Tim Burners-Lee = Father of the Internet
  * HTTP, HTML, URL
* Hakon Wium Lie
  * CSS
  * Gave control to the browswer for determining what things like bold looks lie
  * Super powerful
* Brendan Eich
  * JavaScript
  * "Always bet on JS"
  * Most common language in the world, runs on just about everything
  * All about interactivity
Using a web framework automatically does some functionality like making sure

# EC2 Notes

* My web server: http://34.202.72.116/
* ssh commands
  * ssh -i [key pair file] ubuntu@34.202.72.116
  * chmod 600 [key pair file]
  * ls -l once in to see what is in there. 
  * Once done on the server, exit by running the exit command
 
# 1/22/2024: Caddy, HTTPS, TLS, and Certificates
* Caddy: manages security certificates
* Ability to route requests is called a gateway or reverse proxy: allows you to expose multiple web services as a single external web service
* Caddy handles the creation and rotation of web certificates, allowing easy support of HTTPS
* Caddy serves up all static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. All early application work will be hosted as static files
* Caddy acts as a gateway for subdomain requests to your Simon and startup application services. For example, when a request is made to simon.yourdomain, Caddy will proxy the request to the Simon application running with node.js as an internal web service.
* Curl: A command line browser

Control keys:
* Ctrl c: cancel command
* ctrl r: recall command
* Types of operating systems
  * Linux: the web runs on linux
  * Mac
  * Windows
  * WSL: essentially emulating linux
  * Whatever one I choose, I need to own it. Make sure I really understand the tools available to me.
  * **Important**: When doing anything in this class, use git bash or ubuntu
  * Mac Terminal: Warp is really good
For this class:
* Install live server(VSCode)
* Install GitLens (VSCode)
The more I play with VSCode, the more I will understand the power of the tools

Vi = vim. Use vi
* Use i for insert mode (vi will tell me I'm in insert mode)
* escape to get out of insert mode, back in command mode
* To save: :wq. This writes (saves) and then quits the program
* :w will write

# Lecture 1/26/24: HTML
* Index.html: This is what you load by default if you don't say what resource you want
  * **Make sure to use this for the default html I want to load for my page**
* All HTML elements work like a tree
  * html -> head -> title -> First HTML (appears in tab)
  * html -> body -> Hello World
HTML components:
* \<!DOCTYPE html>: optional, but tells you what version of html you are using
  * This is the declaration for html 5 specifically
* <html lang="en"> tells html to run in englishâ€”lang is an attribute
* html is borken into start tag and end tag
  * \<head> and \</head>
* Document object model: in memory version of html
* \<p> tag
* \<img> tag
* \<h1> through \<h9>: how this is represented is nonstandard: this should be done with html
* div: a block division of content
* span: an inline span of content within a block
* header: put nav elements here with menu, etc.
* Footer
* table: lots of associated tags
* ol, ul: ordered and unordered lists
* a: anchor tag
* img: graphical image reference
* h1-9
* Reserved characters: &, <, >, ", ;, smiley face; entity tags
  * 

html 5 will autofill html in my code

* Link references:
  * Absolute : \<a href = "https://cs260.click/profile.png" /a>
  * Relative: href = "profile.png", href = "../images/profile.png": "These are generally better to use because it gives you more flexibility in moving stuff around
 
Codepen: make sure to fork so I can save my personal version. 

# Codepen Notes
* Can make a free account
* Allows you to experiment with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React; these experiments are saved in a "pen." Every pen has a unique URL.
* CodePen immediately renders your code in the preview window, so you can reduce a problem to something small, quickly iterate ideas, and immediately see the impact.
* Serves as a portfolio of what you have learned.
* When working with assignments involving CodePen to submit work, do the following:
  1. Either create a new pen, or fork an existing example pen.
  2. Conduct the experiment as defined by the assignment
  3. Save assignment periodically so I don't lose any work. Consider using pen collections for different technologies.
  4. Submit the pen's URL in Canvas along with a description of some interesting thing that I learned.
* Codepen is also useful to find coding examples, not just to complete assignments. 

# HTML Notes:
* HTML elements are enclosed in tags
* head element includes metadata about a page and page title.
* Body element represents main content and structure, as opposed to things like headers, footers, asides, and navigation content
* Attributes: every HTML element may have attributes. For example, id attribute can give a unique ID to an element to distinguish it. Class attribute is another common attribute that designates the element as being classified into a named group of elements.
* Attributes are written inside an element tag with a name followed by an optional value.  Use sigle quotes or double quotes to delimit attribute values.
* Hyperlinks: one of the core features that made the web so successful. Represented with anchor element and hyplerlink (href) reference.
* Common elements:
  * html: page container
  * head: header information
  * title: Title of the page
  * meta: metadata for the page such as character set or viewport settings
  * script: JavaScript reference. Either an external reference, or inline
  * include: external content reference
  * body: entire content body of the page
  * header: header of the main content
  * footer: footer of the main content
  * nav: Navigational inputs
  * main: main content of the page
  * section: a section of the main content
  * aside: aside content from the main content
  * div: a block division of content
  * span: an inline span of content
  * h1-h9: text heading
  * p: a paragraph of text
  * b: bring attendion
  * table: table
  * tr: table row:
  * th: table header
  * td: table data
  * ol,ul, ordered or unordered list
  * li: list item
  * a: anchor the text to a hyperlink
  * img: graphical image reference
  * dialog: interactive component such as a confirmation
  * form: a collection of user input
  * input: user input field
  * audio: audio content
  * video: video content
  * svg: scalable vector graphic content
  * iframe: inline frame of another HTML page
  * comments: \<!-- comment text -->
 
* Special characters:
  * &: &amp;
  *  <: &lt;
  *  >: &gt
  * ": &quot;
  * ': &apos;

* html versions introduced different things:
  * html1: format tags
  * html2: tables, internationalization
  * html3: mathML, CSS, frame tags
  * html4: external CSS
  * html5: email, password, media, semantic tags
 
  * by default, a web server will display the HTML file named index.html when a broswer makes a request without asking for a specific html file. Thus, main html is commonly named index.html
 
  * Rendering html: use live server extention or codepen

# HTML Structure Elements:
* Two major purposes of HTML is to provide structure and content to web application
* Common structural elements: body, header, footer, main, section, aside, p, table, ol/ul, div, and span.
* Header contains a paragraph with a span and a navigation containing multiple divisions of sub-content.
* Main can contain multiple sections.
* Proper structure is important so that it makes logical sense to a programmer and so that automated tools like search indexing crawlwers and accessibility screen readers can correctly interpret the document.
* block vs. inline structure: block is a distinct block in the flow of content structure, while an inline element is meant to be inline with the content flow of a block element. So inline flows do not disrupt the flow of a block element's content.

# HTML Input Elements:

* Input elements accept input of user data
Input elements:
* form: input container and submission
  * Main purpose is to submit values of the inputs it contains. JavaScript has more sophisticated methods and control though
  *  Not as useful now because of JavaScript, but is often still used simply as a container
  *  Not required to use this to use input elements. 
* fieldset: labeled input grouping
* input: multiple types of user input
  * many different input types, which you can choose from.
  * types include different flavors of textual, numeric, date, and color inputs
    * text: single line textual value
    * password: obscured password
    * email: email address
    * tel: telephone number
    * url: URL address
    * number: numerical value
    * checkbox: inclusive selection
    * radio: exclusive selection
    * range: range limited number
    * date: year, month, day
    * datetime-local: date and time
    * month: year, month
    * week: week of year
    * color: color
    * file: local file
    * submit: button to trigger form submission
  * most input elements share common attributes
    * name: submitted as the name of the input if used in a form
    * disabled: disables the ability for the user to interact with the input
    * value: initial value of the input
    * required: signifies that a value is required in order to be valid   
* select: selection dropdown
* optgroup: grouped selection dropdown
* option: selection option
* textarea:multi-liine text input
* label: individual input label
* output: output of input
* meter: display value with a known range

* Validating input: several elements have validation built in and won't accept a value that is not a number, URL, outside of range, etc. You can also specify the required attribute on an input element before it can be submitted. 
* Pattern attribute exists on text, search, url, tel, email, and password inputs and when present, provides a regular expression that must match for the input to be considered as valid. JavaScript should also use validation before submission. It is critical to provide sufficient user feedback early in the input process.  A good design will provide feedback as, or before, the user begins to input.

# HTML Media:
* HTML elements that represent media include img, audio, video, svg, and canvas. img, audio, and video elements are all simple references to an external file, but svg and canvas both contain the code to render a visual image that can even be animated.
* Media tags that reference external media all take a URL as an attribute. The path represented by the URL can be either relative or full.
  * A relative path references a file that is served from the same location as the HTML page rendering the element. You want to make the path as relativea s possible so you can move your code around without having to actually adjust all of the external page references. You want to make a patha s relative as possible so that you can move your code around without having to actually adjust all of the external page references.
  * Img element: specify src attribute with URL to source image, and for full accessibility also include an alt attribute describing the image.
  * Audio: use audio element and specify src attribute with URL to source audio file. Can also include controls attribute if you want user to be able to control audio playback.
    * Autoplay attribute starts the audio playing as soon as the audio file is loaded, and the loop attribute keeps it playing over and over. Auto-playing audio is discouraged unless there is a way for user to opt-in to that behavior.
   
  * Video: use video element. Also has controls and autoplay attributes
    * May need to include the crossorigin="anonymous" attribute if requesting files from a different domain than the one serving your content.
  * Svg: powerful and widely supported way to rener graphics inline in HTML.
  * Canvas: introduced to facilitate 2d drawing and animation. HTML for canvas element is simple, but actually drawing on it requires JavaScript support. 


# Lecture 1/29/2024: HTML Continued
* Possible to get around having to rewrite the same html code every time
* With react, I'll only have one page, and dynamically rewrite everything with JavaScript.
* Get the header and footer right the first time and then just rewrite the code
* &reg is an entity tag used for Simon
* method get: and action: play.html: allows me to go to play.html when I login
* Scores.html will have a table of scores
* Need to use a shall script to deploy stuff

# Lecture 1/31/2024: CSS
* HTML doesn't care about spaces.
* &nbsp can be used in html to actually have spaces. Or just use CSS, which is much better
* Way to add style: add attributes
  *style="color:red;margin-left: 3in"
  Use <style> html element and put it in head. Use selector like \<p>
* CSS is all about developing rulesets, or rules.
* Cascading in cascading style sheets refers to how you can inherit styles from above and still have style in nested elements. Like body can have a style and p(paragraph) can have style
* More specific = overriding anything that it inherits. More local is more specific.
* Use \<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" /> and put that in head
* when specificity is equal, whatever is declared last takes precedence.
* Some attributes:
  * font-family: font type
  * font-size: 3em = width of 3 ems
  * font-weight: bold:
  * text-align: center;
  * padding: 1em: padding puts space around it
  * transform: rotate(-45deg): rotate
* Selectors: applying style to a particular kind of tag
  * Id and class selectors
  * Id: the element with the given id: use #name
  * class: all elements with the given tag: use .name
  * element class: any elements with the specific name and class
  * id takes precedence over
* You can use .hover functionality, apply features when you hover over it
* display: block, contents, flex, flexbox, lots of other options. Ie. display, inline, none makes everything disappear
* border: yellow solid thin: this is a composite type, there are three separate border-attributes that describe this.
* border-radius
* know avaiable properties: there are probably around 100-150 out there.
* Units:
  * px
  * pt
  * %
  * Add more to this
* Be familiar with box outline. 
* Content, padding, border, margin in that order going out: (pals before marriage)
*  background: linear-gradient(to bottom, green) adds a gradient on background.

# Startup HTML Important Notes:
* Deployment steps: ./deployFiles.sh -k <yourpemkey> -h <yourdomain> -s startup
  * ./deployFiles.sh -k ~/keys/production.pem -h yourdomain.click -s startup
